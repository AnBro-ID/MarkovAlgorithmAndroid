<h1>Markov algorithm</h1>
<h2>What it is?</h2>
<p>Markov algorithm - is a string rewriting system that uses grammar-like rules to operate on strings of symbols. Markov algorithms are named after the Soviet mathematician Andrey Markov, Jr.</p>
<p>MA sets the rules for converting some origin string using a list consisting of a pattern string <span class="blue">-></span> replacement string.</p>
<p>The MA program consists of a list of numbered lines. The list is scanned from top to bottom, and when a pattern string is found in the origin string, it will be replaced by replacement string. After that the list will be scanned from the beginning.</p>
<p>The pattern string may be empty, in which case the replacement string will be placed at the very beginning of the origin string. Typically, this replacement should appear last in the list to avoid endless loop.
The replacement string may also be empty, in which case the sample string will be removed from the origin string.
The symbol "<span class="blue">.</span>" placed at the end of the replacement string allows to stop the program execution.</p>
<h2>How to work with app?</h2>
<p>In action bar menu there is an item "Task description", it contains editor field where you can enter task description in a free form.</p>
<p>Edit field for origin string is placed on top of the app window.</p>
<p>You can save the state of origin string in the internal buffer and load it back.</p>
<p>Settings allow you to choose the speed of MA execution.</p>
<p>First column in program table contains row numbers and it is filled automatically. In the second column you can write pattern string, and in the third you can write replacement string.</p>
<p>Fourth column can contain a comment for selected row. You can add, delete or replace table rows, but first you need to select row by clicking on it's number.</p>
<p>Executing row has a green background.</p>
<p>It is possible to run program in step-by-step mode.</p>
<p>Programs for MA can be saved in files. When you load a file and save it, the initial state of origin string is automatically written to the buffer. To open "Save as" dialog box you need to hold button with the floppy disk icon.</p>
